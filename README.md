# Contract Collection

Contract Collection is a repository containing a variety of smart contracts, along with deployment scripts and testing. It aims to be a useful resource for developers who are looking for pre-built smart contracts that can be used in their projects but mostly for those who want to learn more about smart contract development. The creation of these contracts are aided by artificial intelligence. 

## Contracts

The contracts in this repository cover a range of use cases and functionalities. Each contract is self-contained and comes with a deployment script that can be used to deploy the contract to the blockchain.

## Deployment Scripts

The deployment scripts are designed to make it easy to deploy the contracts to a variety of blockchain networks. The scripts use Hardhat as the development framework and support deployment to local networks, as well as testnets and mainnets.

## Testing

Each contract comes with a comprehensive set of tests that cover all of the contract's functionality. The tests are written using the Hardhat testing framework and can be run using the `npx hardhat test` command.
